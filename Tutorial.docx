# Things you will need in order to create a VPN service on your Raspverry Pi

1. Raspberry Pi 
  Power Supply
  SD card with or without OS *if it is without you will have to install it*
  Keyboard and Mouse, but you can dial in through ssh if you only have 1 pair
  1 Monitor
  
2. Recomendation:
  Dynamic DNS Service to point to the public ip address at home so you dont have to re configure the VPN everytime
  Check router to see if it supoorts it
  
3. Installing OpenVPN with PiVPN
  curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash

 The default settings are okay to use
 UDP or TDP you should choose UDP unless you are specifically using it for something else
 what port you want to use (1194 is okay unless it is already being used)
 what DNS provider you want to use (any are suitable)
 once doing going through the settings you will have to reboot and then open up with 
 
 pivpn add (name of file Example - Michaels Laptop)
 
 Set how many days the certificate lasts (the default value is fine)
 Enter a password 
 It'll generate an .ovpn file for you under /home/pi/ovpns, which you'll need to connect to your VPNâ€”copy

4. Forward your VPN's port on your router
  Log into your router's configuration page, 
  Find the port forwarding option,
  Forward port 1194 to the internal IP address of your Pi.
